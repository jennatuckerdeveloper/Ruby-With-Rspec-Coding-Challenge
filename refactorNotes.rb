Song 
- Fix case for class id, I think it's snake case? 
- Will probably make instances with empty params? 
- Name string and genre string? 
  
Artist 
- Hitch up remove_song to set featured (song must exist to be featured)
- 


Tests 
- look at it "can add a song to the artist's songs" do and next block 
- Understand the way this stuff gets scoped... it "undoes" the method!
