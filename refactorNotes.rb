Song 
- error handle no empties for name and genre 

  
Artist 
- Hitch up remove_song to set featured (song must exist to be featured)
- Protect from adding songs that are not Song class type 
- Same on featured, etc, if that doesn't come for free... probably does 

tests 
- consider using let?  Is this worth it FIRST? WHY? 

- Any chance hardcoded values cause errors later? 
- Or can be used with more "programmatic" logic? 
- Maybe try to get rid of hardcoded 0,1,other ids 
- What about hardcoded lengths?
