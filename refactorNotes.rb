Song 
- Will probably make instances with empty params? 
- Name string and genre string? 
  
Artist 
- Hitch up remove_song to set featured (song must exist to be featured)
- Protect from adding songs that are not Song class type 
- Same on featured, etc, if that doesn't come for free... probably does 

Tests 
- look at it "can add a song to the artist's songs" do and next block 
- Understand the way this stuff gets scoped... it "undoes" the method!
